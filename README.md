# 🌐 Full-Stack Web Development

This repository contains my learning journey into full-stack web development.

The goal is to understand how modern web applications are built — from frontend interfaces to backend APIs and database integration — and to apply that knowledge through practical exercises and projects.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how the web works (HTTP, client-server model)
- Build frontend interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Develop backend APIs using Node.js and Express
- Connect applications to databases
- Deploy real-world applications
- Build complete full-stack projects

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Covered

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- REST APIs
- Databases (SQL / NoSQL)
- React (planned)
- Deployment workflows

## 🚀 Learning Approach

This repository is focused on:

- Writing code, not just watching tutorials
- Understanding concepts before moving to frameworks
- Building progressively more complex applications
- Practicing consistency over intensity

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

The goal is not just to "learn technologies", but to understand how different parts of a web application interact:

Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database ↔ Deployment

Full-stack development is about building complete systems.
